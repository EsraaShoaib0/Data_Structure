# Data Structures Repository

Welcome to the Data Structures Repository! This repository contains a collection of data structures implemented in C++.

## Introduction

This repository aims to provide efficient and reusable implementations of fundamental data structures using C++. The structures are designed and coded to be understandable, modifiable, and suitable for learning and practical usage.

## Implemented Data Structures

The following data structures are currently included in this repository:

1. **Array:** Dynamic Array Implementation
2. **Linked List:** Singly and Doubly Linked List
3. **Stack:** Array-based and Linked List-based Implementation
4. **Queue:** Array-based and Linked List-based Implementation
5. **Tree:** Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree
6. **Heap:** Min and Max Heap
7. **Hash Table:** Separate Chaining and Open Addressing

Each structure is contained within its own directory and includes detailed comments explaining the implementation and usage.
